# ePort application example

This is an example that implements the dining philosopher problem using an
arbitror as the solution. There are better solutions, but the arbitror solution
works well to illustrate how the ePort application works.

## How to run
In the root folder for the ePort application there is a Makefile, enter that directory and type in
```
make
```

Typing in the above command will build the source code and start an erlang shell with the code lodead.
To start the actual example just type in:
```erlang
example:start().
```
